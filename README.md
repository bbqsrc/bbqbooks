# bbqbooks
Cook the books!

## Usage

Currently, it's just a little bit hacky, but it can be run like so:

<pre class="console">
$ python3 bbqbooks.py
</pre>


Your first thing would be to create a new book, then head to personal settings and set your details. Then create invoices and generate them!
